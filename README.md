This is a fork of https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib , but implements just a subset of its features.

Unlike bitcoinjs-lib, it wants to support all the bitcoin-like altcoins. Unlike bitcoinjs-lib, it includes only subset of its features (that we need in Trezor web services) and the rest of the code is deleted.

TODO: add tests for zcash and dogecoin
